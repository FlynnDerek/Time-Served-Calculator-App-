# Time-Served-Calculator-App-

This app was created to help public defenders in Western Massachusetts quickly and accurately calculate how much time
their clients had served in jail. The app was designed also to calculate a release date for the client based on time already
served and the sentence passed down. The app was commisioned by a small group of lawyers at the Frankin County Bar Association, who
expressed concern that clients were not being credited with the time they had served by the court. 

Using ASP.NET frameworks to write a Progressive Web App (PWA) allowed for a faster and less costly deployment than would 
have been possible, had the app been written in native languages such as Java or Swift. 

The app is free and publicly avaliable on the Google Play Store:
